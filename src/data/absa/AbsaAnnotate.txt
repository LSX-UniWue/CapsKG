how to annotate?

1. there are already positive and negative label, technically, we do not want to change it.

2. for those no annotation, there are two possibilities:

	a. No aspect at all (including co-reference --only focus on the sentence you are reading), we can simply ignore them (keep them unchanged)
	
	b. there do have aspect (must be in the sentence as it is. Do not stem or lemmanize), please annotate the aspect in the following format:
	
		xxxx[=]##....
		
3. we are helping fill a little gap on the neutral so that the format can be in 3-way classification --the same as SemEval2016



Q&A:

1. what is an aspect:

In product reviews, an aspect is basically an attribute or feature of a product (domain). It is not necessary a noun (to be consistent with the requirement that aspect should be a word in the sentence)
